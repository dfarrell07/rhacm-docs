[#managing-apps-with-helm-cluster-repositories]
= Managing apps with Helm repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from Helm repositories in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. You can only perform actions that your role is assigned. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation. 

. From the console navigation menu, click *Applications* to see listed applications and to create new applications.

. *Optional:* After you choose the kind of application you want to create, you can select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create and edit your application. See the YAML samples later in the topic.

. Choose *Helm* from the list of repositories that you can use and enter the values in the correct fields. Follow the guidance in the console and see the YAML editor change values based on your input.

. Click *Create*.

. You are redirected to the _Overview_ page where you can view the details and topology.

// Do we have a link to a repo for a good sample?

The following example channel definition abstracts a Helm repository as a channel:

*Note:* For Helm, all Kubernetes resources contained within the Helm chart must have the label release. `{{ .Release.Name }}`` for the application topology to be displayed properly.

[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: hub-repo
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: helm
  namespace: hub-repo
spec:
    pathname: [https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/] # URL points to a valid chart URL.
    type: HelmRepo

The following channel definition shows another example of a Helm repository channel:

[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: predev-ch
  namespace: ns-ch
  labels:
